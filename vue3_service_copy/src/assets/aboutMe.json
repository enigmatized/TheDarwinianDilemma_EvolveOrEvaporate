"aboutMe": "I am a software engineer by trade and spend too many of my free waking hours managing trading bots as a trader. At least, that is the current phase of my life. Life is short, and I have a wide range of interests, including philosophy, law, economics, math, investing, meditation, spirituality, endurance sports, jiu-jitsu, weightlifting, poetry, spoken word, bio-hacking, writing, improv, sociology, physics, computer hardware, psychology, and history. Having numerous interests is both a blessing and a curse. I enjoy exploring various subjects but recognize the need to make sacrifices if I want to excel in any specific area. Currently, I am using this site to document my life, not for anyone else's sake, but for my own benefit/learning. It serves as a valuable tool, aiding me in remembering what I have learned and experimented with along the way. Moreover, it provides a space for critical self-reflection, allowing me to assess my current direction and reflect on the journey I have undertaken.
